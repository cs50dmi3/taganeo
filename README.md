Designing and implementing solutions for data acquisition, tokenization, and indexing; organizing and securely storing large datasets in compliance with GDPR.

# Data Acquisition, Tokenization & Indexing Pipeline

A scalable and GDPR-compliant data processing pipeline for acquiring, transforming, indexing, and securely storing large datasets. The project also includes advanced search capabilities optimized for fast, accurate querying across both structured and unstructured data.

---

## Overview

Modern AI/ML workflows depend on clean, well-organized, and privacy-compliant datasets.  
This project provides an end-to-end solution for:

- Data acquisition from multiple sources  
- Tokenization and preprocessing  
- Indexing and metadata management  
- Secure, GDPR-compliant data storage  
- High-performance search and retrieval  
- Optimization of data structures for analytical workloads

The architecture supports text, logs, documents, and machine-generated data.

## Key Features

### 🔹 1. Data Acquisition & Processing
- Modular ingestion pipeline for automated data collection.  
- Text tokenization and normalization for downstream ML tasks.  
- Metadata generation for semantic and structural indexing.

### 🔹 2. GDPR-Compliant Storage
- Secure storage of large datasets in distributed environments.  
- Built-in anonymization and pseudonymization mechanisms.  
- Configurable retention policies, audit logging, and access controls.

### 🔹 3. Advanced Search & Retrieval
- Custom indexing supporting fast lookups based on defined criteria.  
- Query optimization for efficient filtering and aggregation.  
- Supports full-text search, vector search, and hybrid indexing approaches.

### 🔹 4. Optimized Data Structures
- Performance-oriented schema design for analytics.  
- Compression and caching to reduce storage footprint and query latency.  
- Modular architecture enabling integration with ML pipelines and external systems.

If you want, I can also:

✅ generate the **repository folder structure**  
✅ add **badges** (build status, license, Python version, etc.)  
✅ prepare a **more technical architecture diagram**  
✅ tailor the README to the exact codebase once you upload it

Just let me know!
